# Hey Folks, Polarity here

I’m Robert, or better known as [Polarity](https://polarity.me). I started making music on the computer sometime in the early ’90s. Back then, people didn’t really take it seriously – real music was something you made in expensive studios with fancy gear and professional musicians. That feels like a lifetime ago, and now it’s pretty much the other way around.

Anyway, what you’ll find here are tools I’ve built for other tools. A lot of it is [presets](https://github.com/polarity/polarity-music-tools) for synths or DAWs like Bitwig. More recently, I’ve been working on [controller scripts for Bitwig](https://github.com/polarity/polarity-music-tools/tree/master/ControllerScripts) too, you can do some pretty cool stuff with those.

Some of the older repos are leftovers from my time as a full-time freelance web developer, back when Internet Explorer was public enemy number one. Good times.
